# Getting Started

Tigris makes it easy to build AI applications with vector embeddings. It is a fully
managed cloud-native database that allows you store and index documents and vector
embeddings for fast and scalable vector search.

## 1. Install the client

Ensure that you are on Typescript version 4.5 or above.

```bash
npm install @tigrisdata/vector
```

## 2. Fetch Tigris API credentials

You can sign up for a free Tigris account <a href={tigrisConfig.signupUrl}>here</a>.

Once you have signed up for the Tigris account, create a new project
called `vectordemo`. Next, make a note of the `clientId` and `clientSecret`,
which you can get from the **Application Keys** section of the project.

## 3. Create the Vector Database client

We will use the project name, clientId and clientSecret from the previous step to
create the vector database client.

```ts
import { VectorDocumentStore } from "@tigrisdata/vector";

const vectorDocStore = new VectorDocumentStore({
  connection: {
    serverUrl: "api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud",
    projectName: "vectordemo",
    clientId: "clientId_here",
    clientSecret: "clientSecret_here",
  },
  indexName: "my_index",
  numDimensions: 3,
});
```

Here, we have created a new `VectorDocumentStore` instance that connects to the
Tigris Vector Database. The `indexName` is the name of the index that will
store your embeddings, documents, and any additional metadata. You can use any
name you like for the index. The `numDimensions` is the number of dimensions of
the vector embeddings.

## 4. Add documents to the index

```ts
await vectorDocStore.addDocumentsWithVectors({
  ids: ["id1", "id2"],
  embeddings: [
    [1.2, 2.3, 4.5],
    [6.7, 8.2, 9.2],
  ],
  documents: [
    {
      content: "This is a document",
      metadata: {
        title: "Document 1",
      },
    },
    {
      content: "This is another document",
      metadata: {
        title: "Document 2",
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

Here, we have added two documents to the index. The `ids` are the unique identifiers
for the documents. The `embeddings` are the vector embeddings for the documents. The
`documents` are the actual documents that you want to store in the index. The `content`
is the text content of the document. The `metadata` is any additional metadata that
you want to store for the document.

## 5. Query the index

You can query the index for the top k most similar documents to a given vector. It's
that simple!

```ts
const results = await vectorDocStore.similaritySearchVectorWithScore({
  query: [1.0, 2.1, 3.2],
  k: 10,
});
console.log(JSON.stringify(results, null, 2));
```

## Next Steps

- Try the [Vector Search quickstart](../../../quickstarts/quickstart-vector-search)
  that uses the OpenAI Embeddings API to generate embeddings for your documents
  and then use Tigris to index these embeddings for fast and scalable vector search.
- Explore the [Hybrid Search section](../hybrid-search) to learn how to combine
  vector search with attribute filtering for more relevant search results.
