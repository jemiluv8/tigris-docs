# Usage Guide

## Installing the client

Ensure that you are on Typescript version 4.5 or above.

```bash
npm install @tigrisdata/vector
```

## Fetching Tigris API credentials

You can sign up for a free Tigris account <a href={tigrisConfig.signupUrl}>here</a>.

Once you have signed up for the Tigris account, create a new project to get started.
Next, make a note of the `clientId` and `clientSecret`, which you can get from the
**Application Keys** section of the project.

## Initializing the client

```ts
import { VectorDocumentStore } from "@tigrisdata/vector";

const vectorDocStore = new VectorDocumentStore({
  connection: {
    serverUrl: "api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud",
    projectName: "vectordemo",
    clientId: "clientId_here",
    clientSecret: "clientSecret_here",
  },
  indexName: "products",
  numDimensions: 3,
});
```

## Creating the index

Tigris uses the concept of an index to store and retrieve documents, metadata
and embeddings. An index is a collection of documents that are related to each
other. For example, you can create an index for products, where each document
represents a product.

:::tip

The name of the index is specified in the `indexName` field of the
`VectorDocumentStore` constructor, as shown above.

:::

```ts
await vectorDocStore.enusreIndex();
```

## Deleting the index

```ts
await vectorDocStore.deleteIndex();
```

## Adding data to the index

```ts
await vectorDocStore.addDocumentsWithVectors({
  ids: ["1", "2", "3"],
  embeddings: [
    [1.2, 2.3, 4.5],
    [6.7, 8.2, 9.2],
    [1.0, 2.1, 3.2],
  ],
  documents: [
    {
      content: "This is a great product. I would recommend it to anyone.",
      metadata: {
        ProductCategory: "Electronics",
        Rating: 5,
      },
    },
    {
      content: "This is a bad product. I would not recommend it to anyone.",
      metadata: {
        ProductCategory: "Books",
        Rating: 1,
      },
    },
    {
      content: "This is a good product. I would recommend it to anyone.",
      metadata: {
        ProductCategory: "Electronics",
        Rating: 4,
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

Each document must have a unique `id` associated with it. The `embeddings` field
is an array of arrays, where each inner array represents the vector
representation of the corresponding document. The `documents` field is an array
of objects, where each object represents the document to be added to the index.

## Querying the index

```ts
const results = await vectorDocStore.similaritySearchVector({
  query: [1.0, 2.1, 3.2],
  k: 2,
});
```

The `query` field is an array of numbers, which represents the vector
representation of the query. The `k` field is the number of closest
matches to retrieve in order.

## Using attribute filtering

Tigris supports filtering by `metadata` fields. For example, you can filter
documents by the `ProductCategory` field.

```ts
const results = await vectorDocStore.similaritySearchVectorWithScore({
  query: [1.0, 2.1, 3.2],
  k: 2,
  filter: {
    "metadata.ProductCategory": "Electronics",
  },
});
```

Filtering supports the following operators:

- `$eq` - Matches documents where the field value is equal to the provided value.
- `$lt` - Matches documents where the field value is less than the provided value.
- `$lte` - Matches documents where the field value is less than or equal to the provided value.
- `$gt` - Matches documents where the field value is greater than the provided value.
- `$gte` - Matches documents where the field value is greater than or equal to the provided value.
- `$not` - Matches documents where the field value is not equal to the provided value.
- `$contains` - Matches documents where the the provided value is a substring of the field value.
- `$regexp` - Matches documents where the field value matches the given regex.

- `$and` - Matches documents where all of the provided filters match.
- `$or` - Matches documents where at least one of the provided filters match.

```ts
const results = await vectorDocStore.similaritySearchVectorWithScore({
  query: [1.0, 2.1, 3.2],
  k: 2,
  filter: {
    $and: [
      {
        "metadata.ProductCategory": "Electronics",
      },
      {
        "metadata.Rating": {
          $gt: 4,
        },
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

## Fetching documents by id

Tigris supports fetching documents in the index by id. The document, metadata
and embeddings associated with the id will be returned.

```ts
const results = await vectorDocStore.getDocuments(["1", "2"]);
```

## Deleting documents by id

Tigris supports deleting documents in the index by id. The document, metadata
and embeddings associated with the id will be deleted.

```ts
const results = await vectorDocStore.deleteDocuments(["1", "2"]);
```

## Deleting documents by filter

Tigris also supports deleting documents in the index by filter.

```ts
const results = await vectorDocStore.deleteDocumentsByFilter({
  "metadata.ProductCategory": "Electronics",
});
```
