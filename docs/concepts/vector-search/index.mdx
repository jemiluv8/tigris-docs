# Vector Search

Tigris makes it easy to build high-performance vector search applications.
It is a fully managed cloud-native database that allows you store and index
documents and vector embeddings for fast and scalable vector search.

Tigris provides the following features:

- **High performance**: Tigris is built from the ground up to provide fast
  vector search. It is optimized for low-latency vector search and high throughput.
- **Real-time**: Tigris provides real-time updates to the index. You can
  add, update, and delete documents and embeddings in real-time.
- **Hybrid search**: Tigris supports hybrid search, which allows you to combine
  vector search with attribute filtering for more relevant search results.
- **Fully managed**: Tigris is a fully managed cloud-native database. You can
  get started with Tigris in minutes and scale as needed with ease.

## Vector Search Workflow

A typical vector search workflow with Tigris involves the following steps:

1. Generate embeddings for your documents.
2. Index your documents and embeddings in Tigris.
3. Generate embeddings for your query.
4. Search for similar documents using the query embeddings.

## Use Cases

Tigris is a general-purpose vector search engine. It can be used for a variety
of use cases, including:

- **Similarity search**: You can generate vector embeddings from your documents
  and index and search through the vectors using Tigris to power your similarity
  search application.
- **Product recommendations**: You can store product information and embeddings
  in Tigris and use it to power your product recommendations for e-commerce.
- **Hybrind search**: You can combine vector search with attribute filtering in
  Tigris for more relevant search results.
- **Image search**: You can generate vector embeddings for image data and index
  them in Tigris to power your image search application.
- **Generative question answering**: You can use Tigris to index relevant
  context in the form of vector embeddings and use it to suppliment a generative
  model to generate more accurate answers.
