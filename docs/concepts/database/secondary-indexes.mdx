# Secondary Indexes

Tigris supports adding secondary indexes to fields in a collection. Adding an index to a field will allow for
fast efficient queries when using the indexed field with [Filters](filters.md).
Secondary indexes are a way for a database to query and retrieve a document by a field that is not the primary key.
If your application is querying Tigris with a filter that does not include a primary key field, then adding a secondary index
on one of the fields in the filter will improve the performance of that query because Tigris can use that field to efficiently
find the correct documents.

## Creating Indexes

An index can be created for a field by updating the schema and adding `index: true` for the field and then
update or create the collection. If the collection is being created for the first time then the index is ready to go
and will be used once there are documents in the collection. If this is an existing collection, then you need to log into
the Web Console to build the indexes.

// register schemas
await tigrisClient.registerSchemas([Catalog]);

## Building indexes in the Web Console

For an existing collection that contains documents, updating the schema and adding the indexes via the
Tigris Web Console will automatically build the indexes for that collection. To do this:

1. Login into the [web console](https://console.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/)
2. Click on the database to add secondary indexes to
3. Select the collection to add secondary indexes to
4. Click on the secondary index tick box to add a secondary index for a field
5. Click on **Save Changes**
6. The secondary indexes will be built in the background.

## Query and Filters

Secondary indexes support all the filters defined in the [filters](filters.md) section.
The index planner will analyze the filter to try and find a field that matches a defined index.
If it cannot find an appropriate index, it will do a full document scan for the collection.

Tigris does not require all the fields in the filter to be a secondary index. Tigris will look at the filter
used and will try and find a field in the filter that has a secondary index. Once it does that, it will read the documents
from that secondary index that matches the field in filter. It will then process that document against the rest of the fields
defined in the filter and make sure it matches all of that.

Lets look at an example to explain this further. For this example we have the following schema:

```ts
@TigrisCollection("catalog")
export class Catalog {
  @PrimaryKey({ order: 1, autogenerate: true })
  id?: number;

  @Field({ index: true })
  name: string;

  @Field({ index: true })
  age: number;

  @Field()
  country: string;
}
```

With a secondary index on `age` and `name`. And if we have three documents that look like this:

```ts
await userColl.insertMany([
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "bob",
    age: 10,
    country: "USA",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "sally",
    age: 30,
    country: "RSA",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "bob",
    age: 25,
    country: "USA",
  },
]);
```

Then for a query like this:

```ts
const cursor = await userColl.findMany({
  filter: { name: "bob", country: "USA", age: { $gt: 20 } },
});
```

Tigris will analyze that filter and see that there are two possible indexes to satisfy that query. It could use the `name` or the `age`
secondary index. Tigris will choose the `name` secondary index because it is using an `equal` filter and Tigris prefers using an `equal` over a range query
like `$gte` when reading from the secondary index. Using the `name` query, it will retrieve documents with id `1` and `3`. Document with id `2` does not have a
name that matches "bob" so it will not be fetched from the index.
Tigris will then process document `1` and document `3` against the full filter to see if the other fields in the document match
the fields defined in the filter. Document `1` will not pass the filter because the `age` field is to low but document with id `3` will pass the filter
and it will be returned back to the user.

### Using `_tigris_created_at` and `_tigris_updated_at`

Tigris has two default indexes created to query a collection by:

1.  `_tigris_created_at`: When a document was created or when a document was added. `_tigris_created_at` will return documents in the order they were created, from earliest to last created.
2.  `_tigris_updated_at`: When the document was last updated. `_tigris_created_at` will return documents in the order they were updated. If a document has not been updated, the updated field will be `null`. This index will first return all documents that have not been updated, followed by the earliest to latest updated documents

These indexes can be queried:

```typescript
userCollection.find({ filter: { _tigris_created_at: { $gte: null } } });
```

### Missing fields

Tigris indexes are a non-sparse index and will index a missing field as `null`.
So if a query has a filter on a field:

```js
collection.findMany({ name: { $gte: null } });
```

The index will return all documents in the collection even if the field is missing
in the document.

## Explain endpoint

To understand which index a query used, an `explain` query can be run
that will give more information on the query. The explain query will return
a JSON payload with the following properties:

- `collection`: The collection that the explain response is run against
- `read_type`: // The Type of read can be either Primary Index scan or Secondary Index. Valid values are `primary index` or `secondary index`
- `filter`: The filter used in the query
- `keyRangeList`: The ranges used to query the index
- `field`: The field used for the query

For example:

```json
{
  "collection": "collection name",
  "read_type": "primary index",
  "filter": { "myField": { "$gte": 10 } },
  "keyRangeList": ["10", "$TIGRIS_MAX"],
  "field": "myField"
}
```

See the [TypeScript SDK](../../sdkstools/typescript/database/secondary-indexes.mdx)
or [Go SDK](../../sdkstools/golang/database/secondary-indexes.mdx) for how to use the explain endpoint.

## Index Status

An index can be in one of three states depending on whether the index can be used for
querying or if the index is still being updated:

- `INDEX WRITE MODE`: The index is being updated with the latest documents but still needs to be built in the background
- `INDEX WRITE MODE BUILDING`: The index is still being updated in the background
- `INDEX ACTIVE`: The index is ready and being used for querying

If an index is added to an existing collection with documents, the index state will `INDEX WRITE MODE`
while Tigris processes all the current documents and creates the indexes for the indexed fields.

The index status for indexes can be fetched from the system using the `DescribeCollection`
method.

## Query Sorting

An index can be used to return a collections document in the order of the fields in the index.
Currently, only a single index is supported for sorting.

```ts
await userCollection.find({
  filter: { age: { $gte: 35 } },
  sort: { order: "$desc", field: "age" },
});
```

## Index Limitations

While secondary indexes are in Beta the following limitations apply:

1. Only top-level fields can be indexed
2. Indexes can only be built for existing collections via the Web Console
